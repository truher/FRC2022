# Firing Models

Here you can find:

* 2-dimensional ballistic model for firing on the high goal with air resistance.
* A bounce model for ball capture by the high goal.
* A Monte-Carlo simulation to optimize muzzle velocity and elevation, and to extract the optimal probability of capture, for a given range.
* A Tensorflow fit to the Monte-Carlo results, for use in the Mesa game simulation.
